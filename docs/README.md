## The Basic Question Answering Ability will break if you skip this step

+ This app depends on Wolfram Alpha - a computational knowledge engine and answer engine developed by Wolfram Research.
+ The app comes with a default sample API key which is required for the Wolfram Alpha engine to function. This will become **outdated** after some time. 
+ To keep September working, you are required to generate your API key and update it in the app settings.
+ Note: Features like opening apps, searching web, playing from youtube etc. doesn't require the usage of this API.

### Steps to create and enter the new API key

+ Create an account at [https://account.wolfram.com/login/create](https://account.wolfram.com/login/create)
![create account](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73932121/154290158-ae1c80b6-b7d9-4e04-9c99-ca80cad29352.png)
+ After creating the account, verify your mail-id. Check your inbox and spam folder. 
+ After verifying your mail id, go to https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps. Click on the **Sign up to get your first AppID** button and fill it out. 
![developer portal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73932121/154291516-7f78a34e-a925-4dca-8cc1-6d6ce012d305.png)

+ Click get a **New AppID** dialog after that. You will then be presented with an API key

<p align = "center">
  <img alt = "appid created" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73932121/154291042-7668fd00-036c-4fc8-b611-f954091ff93e.png">
</p>

+ Copy that API key. The key in the above image is a sample API key. Do not use that value.   
+ Go to September app settings to update the WOLFAPI KEY value.
![settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73932121/154291061-500874be-1a2f-4d76-9e75-98239170ad1f.png)
+ Select **WOLFAPI KEY** in the settings dropdown menu and      
  enter your copied app id in the **ENTER NEW VALUE BOX** and click update.

</p>

### When to change my API key again

+ You can track your API status at [https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/myapps)
+ Once you cross 2K monthly requests, you need to create a new API key and update it in the settings.
+ You need not change your API key if your monthly usage is less than 2K requests.   
+ Note: Features like opening apps, searching web, playing from youtube etc. doesn't require the usage of this API.

## September won't be able to open apps and browsers if you skip this step

+ You can command September to open some default apps, chrome & edge browsers, and even search Google, Youtube, and Wikipedia.
+ For this to work properly, you need to go to settings and ensure that the app paths are correct. (The default app paths will work in most of the systems)  
+ You can change those paths by entering a new value and clicking update in settings.
![settings](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73932121/154291061-500874be-1a2f-4d76-9e75-98239170ad1f.png)

## Additional Debugging
+ Sometimes the antivirus software may hinder September from uploading & downloading audio stream data or listening to the microphone. Make sure you trust the application in your antivirus software settings if the voice detection doesn't work.
+ Requires active internet connection to function.   
+ Make sure that your mic and speaker are in proper working condition.
